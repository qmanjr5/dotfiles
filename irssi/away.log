12:50 JustinMartin    │eg  No route to host on that IP address
12:51 JustinMartin    │eg  It means that the port isn't open, most likely.
12:51 JustinMartin    │eg  Is that your own system?
12:52 JustinMartin    │eg  Then it's probably a firewall
12:52 JustinMartin    │eg  Especially if you're running Fedora
12:52 JustinMartin    │eg  Which I think you said you were going to
12:53 JustinMartin    │eg  Still probably a firewall
13:50 JustinMartin    │eg  Why not?
13:53 JustinMartin    │eg  Overcome them
13:53 JustinMartin    │eg  You won't overcome those issues by avoiding interaction :P

20:04 BlakeDearman    │eg  the reporter said
20:05 BlakeDearman    │eg  No without batting an eyelash
